There can be two kinds of data sources based on their reliability. Sources (like Kafka and Flume) allow the transferred data to be acknowledged. If the system receiving data from these reliable sources acknowledges the received data correctly, it can be ensured that no data will be lost due to any kind of failure. This leads to two kinds of receivers:

Reliable Receiver - A reliable receiver correctly sends acknowledgment to a reliable source when the data has been received and stored in Spark with replication.
Unreliable Receiver -
An unreliable receiver does not send acknowledgment to a source. This can be used for sources that do not support acknowledgment, or even for reliable sources when one does not want or need to go into the complexity of acknowledgment.
The details of how to write a reliable
receiver are discussed in the Custom Receiver Guide.
